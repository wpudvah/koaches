                        <h4>Volunteering</h4>
                        <p>Everyone is looking for fun and exciting volunteering opportunities. What better way to get involved and bolster your résumé than coaching kids on how to play basketball, how to be a team player, and most importantly, how to have fun. This opporunitiy is open to all students currently enrolled at the University, regardless of year. Time commitment is minimal -  one one-hour practice and one one-hour game each week for 8 weeks. Gyms are nearby and are an easy commute.</p>
                        <p>With a variety of age groups to choose from, there is sure to be a team that fits. Ages range from kindergarten through the fourth grade, so various skill levels are represented well in the program. Whether you're looking to teach the fundamentals of the game or want to implement a two-three zone defense, the opportunities are endless! Age groups may be requested upon registration for the program. It is highly recommended to sign up with a friend or two!</p>

                        <h4>Community Building</h4>
                        <p>Campus Y has a plethora of opportunities that allow Wash U students to get engaged and immersed in the local communities surrounding the university. Koaches 4 Kids is one of these fantastic opportunites to strengthen these surrounding areas and communities. Burst out of the "Wash U Bubble" and get involved with inner-city youth! Games and practices are located in South City and South County, St. Louis.</p>
                        <p>Getting involved means more than just racking up the volunteering/community service hours - it means making a difference in our community! Being an active participant in programs such as Koaches 4 Kids gives students opportunities to give back to the community that supports their education and institution. Opening students' eyes to the surrounding communities gives them a valuable and unique education not always available in the classroom.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="service-three">
                        <h4>Be a Role Model</h4>
                        <p>Becoming involved with Koaches 4 Kids is more than just an opportunity to have fun and shoot some hoops - it's a chance to be an influential member of a youth's development. Being a role model for these inner-city youth is a mutually beneficial relationship - each party has an oppportunity to learn lots from one another. Hopefully the kids will learn as much about life as they do about basketball through the Koaches 4 Kids program.</p>
                        <p>These kids need people that they can look up to and admire. They need to learn not only about the fundamentals of basketball but about to how operate in a team environment, how to contribute to a team, and how to conduct themselves both on and off the court. Providing these youth with role models from the Wash U student body influences them in positive ways, both on and off the court.</p>

                        <h4>Have Fun!</h4>
                        <p>The most important aspect of volunteering with Koaches 4 Kids is <b>having fun!</b> It is such a great opportunity and is a fun relief from the daily grind of college. Not many other volunteering opportunites involve this level of physical activity and fun - you will be genuinely excited to show up to practice and games with your team. </p>
                        <p>Having fun is the main goal of Koaches 4 Kids. We want it to be extremely enjoyable for all parties involved - kids, parents, and coaches. Winning is great, but the most important thing is having fun. Lace up your shoes, throw on some shorts and sign up today to be a Koach for our next basketball session!</p>

                <br>
                <p>With a number of new volunteers every year, Koaches 4 Kids contiunes to grow and become one of the most exciting volunteer opportunities on campus. And with ages ranging from Kindergarten through 4th grade, there's a team for everyone!</p>
                <p>Just ask current Koach Pedro Cebollero (pictured, left), a senior at Wash U - "I've volunteered with Koaches 4 Kids three out of my four years on campus and I've enjoyed each and every season; it's been a fun and rewarding experience. I've gotten a few of my friends to coach with me, which makes the whole experience that much better. If I wasn't graduating in the spring I'd be back here next season!"</p>
                <p>There's plenty more students like Pedro that volunteer multiple times throughout their college career. It's a testament to how much fun and how enjoyable this program really is. </p>
